<mark> This is a fork of [dtinth](https://github.com/dtinth/)'s [comic-mono](https://github.com/dtinth/comic-mono-font/)</mark>

I do not know how to make and modify fonts, so this was all done with trial and error through FontForge
## Changes from Comic Mono
 - General Ascent to 1920 and Descent to 128
 - Use the generated Ascent values win, typo and HHead Ascent to set each Descent to 10% of their respective Ascent.

### To-do
 - [ ] Run in through [NerdFont patcher]() with the `--complete` option;
 - [ ] Better align special characters (like: `=`, `*`, `+`);
 - [ ] Add (at least latin) languages accents (i.e.: `á`, `ç`, `ê`);
 - [ ] Add Ligatures that are actually Comic;

# Comic Mono
A legible monospace font... the very typeface you’ve been trained to recognize since childhood. This font is a fork of [Shannon Miwa](https://github.com/shannpersand)’s [Comic Shanns](https://github.com/shannpersand/comic-shanns) (version 1).

## Differences from Comic Shanns
1. All glyphs have been [adjusted](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/kj0prs/comic_mono_font/ghc7krt/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to have exactly the same width (using code based on [monospacifier](https://github.com/cpitclaudel/monospacifier)).
2. The glyph metrics have been adjusted to make it display better alongside system font, based on [Cousine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cousine)’s metrics.
3. The name is changed to `Comic Mono`.
4. A bold version of the font is generated using [FontForge’s Embolden](https://fontforge.github.io/Styles.html#Embolden) operation.

I have no font creation skills; I’m just a software developer. This font family is created by patching the original font, [Comic Shanns (v1)](https://github.com/shannpersand/comic-shanns), using a Python script, [`generate.py`](generate.py).
